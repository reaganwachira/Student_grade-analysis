Write a Python program that analyzes students' grades stored in a dictionary. Your program should calculate the average grade for each student, determine the highest average grade among all students, and identify students with average grades above a specified threshold.
Requirements:
Data Structure: Represent students in a dictionary with their names as keys and their scores (a list of integers) as values.
Average Grade Calculation: For each student, calculate their average grade from the scores provided in the list.
Highest Average Grade: Determine which student has the highest average grade and print their name along with the grade.
Above Threshold: Identify and print the names of students whose average grade is above a certain threshold (e.g., 85).
Output: Your program should print:
The average grade for each student.
The name and average grade of the student with the highest average.
The names of students with average grades above the threshold.

Solution:

The provided Python program analyzes students' grades based on the input data. Here's how it works:

Data Structure: Students are represented in a dictionary with their names as keys and their scores as values.
Average Grade Calculation: The program calculates the average grade for each student by summing their scores and dividing by the number of scores.
Highest Average Grade: It determines the student with the highest average grade and prints their name along with the grade.
Above Threshold Identification: It identifies and prints the names of students whose average grade is above a specified threshold.
